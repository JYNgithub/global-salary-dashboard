# ðŸ“Š Global Data Science and ML Salary Dashboard

This is a dashboard web app that extract insights from salary data in the Data Science and Machine Learning Field.

# Usage

~~The fastest way to access the dashboard: https://global-salary-dashboard.onrender.com/~~

As of August 2025, the dashboard is only available via local deployment and is no longer accessible online. This is to redirect my focus on newer projects instead.
